# Magento 2 - Hot Tags

For Magento 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x and 2.4.x

## Benefits

The Zero1 Hot Tags extension for Magento 2 adds a message (Hot Tag) on the product details page to show how popular and in-demand your products are based on the actions of your users. This is a very powerful way of increasing visibility of your most popular products and creating urgency on the frontend of your site. 

Shoppers tend to have FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and they don't want to miss out on something that seems popular. If messages on a site suggest a product is in high demand — "Trending Now! Added to basket 100 times today" - customers can often make impulse buys and also justify their purchase based on the popularity of an item.

Having this messaging is a great way of increasing that urgency and helping towards higher CTR and conversion. The data that is presented on the frontend is accurate and fresh, and therefore presented honestly to your customers.

## Features

- Choose between 'Added to basket' or 'Viewed' as your trigger
- Choose your timescale; e.g. 'in the last hour', 'today'
- Fully customisable text
- Choose the minimum number of actions / triggers before showing the tag
- Customise the styling of the tag

## Installation

```
composer require zero1/module-hot-tags
```
